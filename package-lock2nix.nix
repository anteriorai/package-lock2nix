# Parse a package.json and package-lock.json into a built derivation.  This
# module parses the package-lock.json into an eval-time dependency tree to
# download and install every dependency as individual nix derivations.  It
# combines them all into one big final node_modules directory, similar to what
# ‘npm ci’ would do.  It is npm workspace aware and does treeshaking of
# dependencies when building individual packages for different workspaces.
#
# The API is not set in stone: this works for us, for now, it’s quite ad-hoc, we
# hope to learn about a better API as usage continues.
#
# This module is inspired by:
#
# - https://nmattia.com/posts/2022-12-18-lockfile-trick-package-npm-project-with-nix/
#
# - https://github.com/pyproject-nix/uv2nix
#
# It’s more involved than the former, and less featureful than the latter.
